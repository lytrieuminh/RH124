[student@workstation ~]$ lab start services-review


1. Use the ssh command to log in to the serverb machine as the student user. On the serverb machine, start the psacct service.
    1.1 Log in to the serverb machine as the student user and switch to the root user.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@serverb
    ...output omitted...
    [student@serverb ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for student: student

    1.2 Verify the status of the psacct service. The psacct service is in an inactive and disabled state.
    The disabled state confirms that the service does not start at boot time.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl status psacct

    1.3 Start the psacct service.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl start psacct

    1.4 Verify that the psacct service is running.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl is-active psacct
    active


2. Configure the psacct service to start at system boot.
    2.1 Enable the psacct service to start at system boot.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl enable psacct

    2.2 Verify that the psacct service is enabled to start at system boot.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl is-enabled psacct
    enabled


3. Stop the rsyslog service.
    3.1 Verify the status of the rsyslog service. Notice that the rsyslog service is running and enabled to start at boot time. Press q to exit the command.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl status rsyslog

    3.2 Stop the rsyslog service.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl stop rsyslog

    3.3 Verify that the rsyslog service is stopped.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl is-active rsyslog
    inactive


4. Configure the rsyslog service so that it does not start at system boot.
    4.1 Disable the rsyslog service so that it does not start at system boot.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl disable rsyslog

    4.2 Verify that the rsyslog service does not start during the boot process.
    [root@serverb ~]# systemctl is-enabled rsyslog
    disabled


5. Reboot the serverb machine before evaluating the lab.
[root@serverb ~]# systemctl reboot
