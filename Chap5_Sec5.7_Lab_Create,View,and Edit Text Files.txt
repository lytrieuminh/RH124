[student@workstation ~]$ lab start edit-review


1. On workstation, create the lab_file shell variable and assign editing_final_lab.txt as the value. List the contents of the student home directory, including hidden directories and files, as well as permissions, file sizes, and modification times, and redirect the output to the editing_final_lab.txt file by using the shell variable.

On the workstation machine, create the lab_file shell variable and assign a value of editing_final_lab.txt. Use the ls -al command in the student home directory and redirect the output to the editing_final_lab.txt file.
[student@workstation ~]$ lab_file=editing_final_lab.txt
[student@workstation ~]$ ls -al > $lab_file


2. Use Vim to edit the editing_final_lab.txt file. Use the lab_file shell variable.
[student@workstation ~]$ vim $lab_file


3. Enter the line-based visual mode of Vim. Your screen output might differ from these examples. Remove the first three lines of the editing_final_lab.txt file.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the first character in the first line. Enter the line-based visual mode with Shift+V. Move down by using the down arrow key twice to select the first three lines. Delete the lines by typing x.


4. Enter the visual mode of Vim. Remove the last seven characters from the first column on the first line. Preserve only the first four characters of the first column.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the last character of the first column on the first line. Delete the selection by typing x.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the fifth character of the first column on the first line. Enter the visual mode by typing v.


5. Enter the visual block mode of Vim. Repeat the operation of the previous step, but this time select from the second to the last line. Preserve only the first four characters of the first column.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the fifth character of the second line. Enter the visual mode by using the Ctrl+V control sequence. Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the last character of the first column on the last line. Delete the selection by typing x.


6. Enter the visual block mode of Vim and remove the fourth column of the file.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the first character of the fourth column. Enter the visual block mode by using Ctrl+V. Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the last character and row of the fourth column. Delete the selection by typing x.

Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the first character of the current seventh column. Enter the visual block mode by typing Ctrl+V. Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the last character of the seventh column on the last row. Delete the selection by typing x.


8. Enter the visual line mode of Vim and remove the rows that contain the Desktop and Public strings.
Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at any character on the Desktop row. Enter visual mode with uppercase V. The full line is selected. Delete the selection by typing x. Repeat the operation for the row with the Public string.

To save and exit the file, enter the last-line :wq command.


10. Back up the editing_final_lab.txt file and append the date (in seconds) at the end of the file name preceded with an underscore (_) character. Use the lab_file shell variable.
Use the cp command to back up the editing_final_lab.txt file. Use the $(date +%s) command at the end of the backup name preceded with an underscore character to make the name unique.
[student@workstation ~]$ cp $lab_file editing_final_lab_$(date +%s).txt


11. Append a dashed line to the editing_final_lab.txt file. The dashed line should contain 12 dash (-) characters for this lab to be graded correctly. Use the lab_file shell variable.
Use the echo command with 12 dashes and append the output to the editing_final_lab.txt file.
[student@workstation ~]$ echo "------------" >> $lab_file


12. List the content of the Documents directory, and append the output to the editing_final_lab.txt file, and display the output in the terminal. Use the tee command and the lab_file shell variable.
Use the ls command to list the Documents directory and pipe the output to the tee -a command to append the output to the editing_final_lab.txt file.
[student@workstation ~]$ ls Documents/ | tee -a $lab_file
