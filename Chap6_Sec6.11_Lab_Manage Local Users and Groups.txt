#Lab: Manage Local Users and Groups
#🐱‍🚀🐱‍👤🐱‍💻🐱‍🐉🐱‍👓🐱‍🏍✨
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start users-review


1. From the workstation machine, open an SSH session to the serverb machine as the student user and switch to the root user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@serverb
...output omitted...
[student@serverb ~]$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for student: student
[root@serverb ~]#

2. On the serverb machine, ensure that newly created users must change their passwords every 30 days.
    2.1 Set PASS_MAX_DAYS to 30 in the /etc/login.defs file. Use administrative rights when opening the file with the text editor.
    You can use the vim /etc/login.defs command for this step.
    ...output omitted...
    # Password aging controls:
    #
    #       PASS_MAX_DAYS   Maximum number of days a password may be
    #       used.
    #       PASS_MIN_DAYS   Minimum number of days allowed between
    #       password changes.
    #       PASS_MIN_LEN    Minimum acceptable password length.
    #       PASS_WARN_AGE   Number of days warning given before a
    #       password expires.
    #
    PASS_MAX_DAYS 30
    PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
    PASS_WARN_AGE   7
    ...output omitted...

3. Create the consultants group with a GID of 35000.
[root@serverb ~]# groupadd -g 35000 consultants

4. Configure administrative rights to enable all consultants group members to execute any command as any user. Avoid using visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file.
Instead, place the configuration file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory.
    4.1 Create the /etc/sudoers.d/consultants file and add the following content to it.
    You can use the vim /etc/sudoers.d/consultants command for this step.
    %consultants  ALL=(ALL) ALL

5. Create the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 users with the consultants group as their supplementary group.
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant1
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant2
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant3

6. Set the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 passwords to redhat.
[root@serverb ~]# passwd consultant1
Changing password for user consultant1.
New password: redhat
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password: redhat
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[root@serverb ~]# passwd consultant2
Changing password for user consultant2.
New password: redhat
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password: redhat
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully
[root@serverb ~]# passwd consultant3
Changing password for user consultant3.
New password: redhat
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password: redhat
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully

7. Set the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 accounts to expire in 90 days from the current day.
    7.1 Determine the date 90 days in the future. This returned date is an example; the value that you see, to use in the following step, is based on the current date and time in your system.
    [root@serverb ~]# date -d "+90 days" +%F
    2022-06-08

    7.2 Set the account expiry date of the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 accounts to the same value as determined in the preceding step. For example:
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -E 2022-06-08 consultant1
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -E 2022-06-08 consultant2
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -E 2022-06-08 consultant3

8. Change the password policy for the consultant2 account to require a new password every 15 days.
[root@serverb ~]# chage -M 15 consultant2

9. Additionally, force the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 users to change their passwords on the first login.
    9.1 Set the last day of the password change to 0 so that users must change the password when they first log in to the system.
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -d 0 consultant1
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -d 0 consultant2
    [root@serverb ~]# chage -d 0 consultant3

    9.2 Return to the workstation system as the student user.
    [root@serverb ~]# exit
    [student@serverb ~]$ exit
