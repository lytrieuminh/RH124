[student@workstation ~]$ lab start perms-cli


1. From workstation, log in to servera as the student user and switch to the root user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera
[student@servera ~]$ sudo -i

2. Create the /home/consultants directory.
[root@servera ~]# mkdir /home/consultants

3. Change the group ownership of the consultants directory to consultants.
[root@servera ~]# chown :consultants /home/consultants

4. Modify the permissions of the consultants group to allow its group members to create files in, and delete files from, the /home/consultants directory.
The current permissions forbid others from accessing the files. You must set the appropriate permissions.
    4.1 Verify that the permissions of the consultants group allow its group members to create files in, and delete files from, the /home/consultants directory.
    Note that the consultants group currently does not have write permission.
    [root@servera ~]# ls -ld /home/consultants

    4.2 Add write permission to the consultants group. Use the symbolic method for setting the appropriate permissions.
    [root@servera ~]# chmod g+w /home/consultants
    [root@servera ~]# ls -ld /home/consultants

    4.3 Forbid others from accessing files in the /home/consultants directory. Use the octal method for setting the appropriate permissions.
    [root@servera ~]# chmod 770 /home/consultants
    [root@servera ~]# ls -ld /home/consultants

5. Exit the root shell and switch to the consultant1 user. The password is redhat.
[root@servera ~]# exit
logout
[student@servera ~]$ su - consultant1
Password: redhat
[consultant1@servera ~]$

6. Navigate to the /home/consultants directory and create a file called consultant1.txt.
    6.1 Change to the /home/consultants directory.
    [consultant1@servera ~]$ cd /home/consultants

    6.2 Create an empty file called consultant1.txt.
    [consultant1@servera consultants]$ touch consultant1.txt

7. List the contents of the /home/consultants directory.
[consultant1@servera consultants]$ ls

8. Exit the shell and switch to the consultant2 user. The password is redhat.
[consultant1@servera consultants]$ exit
[student@servera ~]$ su - consultant2
Password: redhat
[consultant2@servera ~]$

9. Navigate to the /home/consultants directory. Ensure that the consultant2 user can add content to the consultant1.txt file.
    9.1 Change to the /home/consultants directory. Create an empty file called consultant2.txt.
    [consultant2@servera ~]$ cd /home/consultants/
    [consultant2@servera consultants]$ touch consultant2.txt

10. List the contents of the /home/consultants directory.
[consultant2@servera consultants]$ ls

11. Return to the workstation system as the student user.
[consultant2@servera consultants]$ exit
[student@servera ~]$ exit
