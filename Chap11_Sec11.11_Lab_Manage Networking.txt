[student@workstation ~]$ lab start net-review


1. Log in to the serverb machine as the student user. Switch to the root user.
    1.1 Log in to the serverb machine as the student user and switch to the root user.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@serverb
    ...output omitted...
    [student@serverb ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for student: student
    [root@serverb ~]#


2. Create a connection with a static network configuration by using the settings in the table.

Parameter	Setting
Connection name	lab
Interface name	ethX (might vary; use the interface with the 52:54:00:00:fa:0b MAC address)
IP address	172.25.250.11/24
Gateway address	172.25.250.254
DNS address	172.25.250.254


    2.1 Determine the interface name and the current active connection's name.
    ❗❗❗IMPORTANT:
    The name of your connection might vary according to the course platform and hardware in use.
    The solution assumes that the interface name is eth0 and that the connection name is System eth0.
    Locate the current connection name (such as System eth0 or Wired connection 1) that is associated with the interface in the table.
    Use the located connection name to replace System eth0 throughout this exercise if different.


    [root@serverb ~]# ip link
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 52:54:00:00:fa:0b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enp0s3
        altname ens3
    3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 8942 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fa:16:3e:a1:e8:d9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enp0s4
        altname ens4
    [root@serverb ~]# nmcli con show --active
    NAME         UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
    System eth0  5fb06bd0-0bb0-7ffb-45f1-d6edd65f3e03  ethernet  eth0
    System eth1  9c92fad9-6ecb-3e6c-eb4d-8a47c6f50c04  ethernet  eth1
    lo           f3266717-b049-4b7a-a37b-0b34671a1d77  loopback  lo



    2.2 Create the lab connection profile based on the table information in the instructions.
    Associate the profile with your network interface, as listed in the output of the previous ip link command.

    [root@serverb ~]# nmcli con add con-name lab ifname eth0 type ethernet \
    ipv4.method manual ipv4.dns '172.25.250.254' \
    ipv4.addresses '172.25.250.11/24' ipv4.gateway '172.25.250.254'
    Connection 'lab' (8321cc19-5bdf-46fb-8046-10cc4203732c) successfully added.


3. Configure the new connection to start automatically. Other connections should not start automatically.
[root@serverb ~]# nmcli con mod "lab" connection.autoconnect yes
[root@serverb ~]# nmcli con mod "System eth0" connection.autoconnect no


4. Modify the new connection to use also the 10.0.1.1/24 IP address.
[root@serverb ~]# nmcli con mod "lab" +ipv4.addresses '10.0.1.1/24'
[root@serverb ~]# nmcli con reload


5. Configure the hosts file so that you can reference the 10.0.1.1 IP address with the private name.
[root@serverb ~]# echo "10.0.1.1 private" >> /etc/hosts


6. Reboot the system.
[root@serverb ~]# systemctl reboot
Connection to serverb closed by remote host.
Connection to serverb closed.
[student@workstation ~]$


7. Verify that the serverb machine is initialized.
[student@workstation ~]$ ping -c3 serverb
