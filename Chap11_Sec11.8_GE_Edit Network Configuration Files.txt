#🤓 Guided Exercise: Edit Network Configuration Files
#🐱‍🚀🐱‍👤🐱‍💻🐱‍🐉🐱‍👓🐱‍🏍✨
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start net-edit


1. On the workstation machine, use the ssh command to log in to the servera machine as the student user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera


2. Locate network interface names with the ip link command.
❗❗❗IMPORTANT:
Network interface names are determined by their bus type and the detection order of devices during boot.
Your network interface names might vary according to the course platform and hardware in use.

Locate the network interface name that is associated with the Ethernet address on your system. Record or remember this name, and use it to replace the en_X_ placeholder in subsequent commands.
The active connection is called System eth0, and the configuration is in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"System eth0.nmconnection" file.

[student@servera ~]$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:00:fa:0a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp0s3
    altname ens3
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 8942 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:15:d4:0d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp0s4
    altname ens4


[student@servera ~]$ nmcli con show --active
NAME         UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
System eth0  5fb06bd0-0bb0-7ffb-45f1-d6edd65f3e03  ethernet  eth0
System eth1  9c92fad9-6ecb-3e6c-eb4d-8a47c6f50c04  ethernet  eth1
lo           0e77d074-dd20-465e-87f5-e3974e6f42ab  loopback  lo


[student@servera ~]$ ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
'System eth0.nmconnection'


3. On the servera machine, switch to the root user, and then edit the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"System eth0.nmconnection" file to add the 10.0.1.1/24 address.
    3.1 Use the sudo -i command to switch to the root user.

    [student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for student: student
    [root@servera ~]#


    3.2 Edit the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"System eth0.nmconnection" configuration file.

    Add the 10.0.1.1/24 address as the second address below the first address in the file.
    ...output omitted...
    [ipv4]
    address1=172.25.250.10/24,172.25.250.254
    address2=10.0.1.1/24
    ...output omitted...


4. Activate the new network address with the nmcli command.
    4.1 Reload the configuration changes for NetworkManager to read the changes.
    [root@servera ~]# nmcli con reload

    4.2 Activate the connection with the changes.
    [root@servera ~]# nmcli con up "System eth0"
    Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/4)


5. Verify that the new IP address is assigned successfully.
[root@servera ~]# ip -br addr show eth0
eth0             UP             172.25.250.10/24 10.0.1.1/24 fe80::5054:ff:fe00:fa0a/64


6. Return to the workstation machine as the student user.
[root@servera ~]# exit
logout
[student@servera ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to servera closed.
[student@workstation ~]$


7. On the serverb machine, edit the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"System eth0.nmconnection" file to add an address of 10.0.1.2/24 and load the new configuration.
    7.1 Log in to the serverb machine as the student user and switch to the root user.

    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@serverb
    ...output omitted...
    [student@serverb ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for student: student
    [root@serverb ~]#


    7.2 Edit the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"System eth0.nmconnection" configuration file.
    Add the 10.0.1.2/24 address as the second address below the first address in the file.

    ...output omitted...
    [ipv4]
    address1=172.25.250.11/24,172.25.250.254
    address2=10.0.1.2/24
    ...output omitted...


    7.3 Reload the configuration changes for NetworkManager to read the changes.

    [root@serverb ~]# nmcli con reload


    7.4 Activate the connection with the changes.

    [root@serverb ~]# nmcli con up "System eth0"
    Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/4)


    7.5 Verify that the new IP address is assigned successfully.

    [root@serverb ~]# ip -br addr show eth0
    eth0             UP             172.25.250.11/24 10.0.1.2/24 fe80::5054:ff:fe00:fa0b/64


8. Test connectivity between the servera and serverb machines by using the new network addresses.
    8.1 From the serverb machine, ping the new address of the servera machine.

    [root@serverb ~]# ping -c3 10.0.1.1
    PING 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.23 ms

    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.372/0.679/1.225/0.387 ms


    8.2 Return to the workstation machine as the student user.

    [root@serverb ~]# exit
    logout
    [student@serverb ~]$ exit
    logout
    Connection to serverb closed.
    [student@workstation ~]$


    8.3 Access the servera machine as the student user to ping the new address of the serverb machine.

    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera ping -c3 10.0.1.2
    PING 10.0.1.2 (10.0.1.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
