#🐱‍🚀🐱‍👤🐱‍💻🐱‍🐉🐱‍👓🐱‍🏍✨
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start services-identify


1. Use the ssh command to log in to the servera machine as the student user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera

2. List all the installed service units on the servera machine. Press q to exit the command.
[student@servera ~]$ systemctl list-units --type=service

3. List all socket units, active and inactive, on the servera machine.
[student@servera ~]$ systemctl list-units --type=socket --all

4. Explore the status of the chronyd service. You can use this service for network time protocol synchronization (NTP).
    4.1 Display the status of the chronyd service. Note the process ID of any active daemon. Press q to exit the command.
    [student@servera ~]$ systemctl status chronyd

    4.2 Confirm that the chronyd daemon is running by using its process ID.
    In the preceding command, the output of the process ID that is associated with the chronyd service is 747. The process ID might differ on your system.
    [student@servera ~]$ ps -p 747
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    747 ?        00:00:00 chronyd


5. Explore the status of the sshd service. You can use this service for secure encrypted communication between systems.
    5.1 Determine whether the sshd service is enabled to start at system boot.
    [student@servera ~]$ systemctl is-enabled sshd
    enabled

    5.2 Determine whether the sshd service is active without displaying all the status information.
    [student@servera ~]$ systemctl is-active sshd
    active

    5.3 Display the status of the sshd service. Press q to exit the command.
    [student@servera ~]$ systemctl status sshd


6. List the enabled or disabled states of all service units. Press q to exit the command.
[student@servera ~]$ systemctl list-unit-files --type=service


7. Return to the workstation system as the student user.
[student@servera ~]$ exit
