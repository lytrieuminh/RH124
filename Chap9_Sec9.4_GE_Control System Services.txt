[student@workstation ~]$ lab start services-control


1. Log in to the servera machine as the student user and switch to the root user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera
...output omitted...
[student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for student: student

2. Restart and reload the sshd service, and observe the results.
    2.1 Display the status of the sshd service. Note the process ID of the sshd daemon. Press q to exit the command.
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl status sshd

    2.2 Restart the sshd service and view the status. In this example, the process ID of the daemon changes from 784 to 1193. Press q to exit the command.
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl restart sshd
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl status sshd

    2.3 Reload the sshd service and view the status. The process ID of the daemon does not change. Press q to exit the command.
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl reload sshd
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl status sshd

3. Verify that the chronyd service is running. Press q to exit the command.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl status chronyd

4. Stop the chronyd service and view the status. Press q to exit the command.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl stop chronyd
[root@servera ~]# systemctl status chronyd

5. Determine whether the chronyd service is enabled to start at system boot.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl is-enabled chronyd
enabled


6. Reboot the servera machine, and then view the status of the chronyd service.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl reboot
Connection to servera closed by remote host.
Connection to servera closed.
[student@workstation ~]$


    6.1 Log in as the student user on the servera machine, and switch to the root user. View the status of the chronyd service. Press q to exit the command.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera
    ...output omitted...
    [student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for student: student
    [root@servera ~]# systemctl status chronyd


7. Disable the chronyd service so that it does not start at boot, and then view the status of the service. Press q to exit the command.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl disable chronyd
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/chronyd.service.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl status chronyd


8. Reboot servera, and then view the status of the chronyd service.
[root@servera ~]# systemctl reboot

    8.1 Log in as the student user on servera, and view the status of the chronyd service. Press q to exit the command.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera
    ...output omitted...
    [student@servera ~]$ systemctl status chronyd
    ○ chronyd.service - NTP client/server
        Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: inactive (dead)
        Docs: man:chronyd(8)
                man:chrony.conf(5)


9. Return to the workstation system as the student user.
[student@servera ~]$ exit
