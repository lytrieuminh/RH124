#🤓 Guided Exercise: Manage Default Permissions and File Access
#🐱‍🚀🐱‍👤🐱‍💻🐱‍🐉🐱‍👓🐱‍🏍✨
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start perms-default


1. Log in to the servera system as the student user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera

2. Switch to the operator1 user with redhat as the password.
[student@servera ~]$ su - operator1
Password: redhat
[operator1@servera ~]$

3. List the operator1 user's default umask value.
[operator1@servera ~]$ umask
0022

4. Create a /tmp/shared directory. In the /tmp/shared directory, create a defaults file. Look at the default permissions.
    4.1 Create the /tmp/shared directory. List the permissions of the new directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ mkdir /tmp/shared
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -ld /tmp/shared

    4.2 Create a defaults file in the /tmp/shared directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/defaults

    4.3 List the permissions of the new file.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/defaults

5. Change the group ownership of the /tmp/shared directory to the operators group. Confirm the new ownership and permissions.
    5.1 Change the group ownership of the /tmp/shared directory to the operators group.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ chown :operators /tmp/shared

    5.2 List the permissions of the /tmp/shared directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -ld /tmp/shared

    5.3 Create a group file in the /tmp/shared directory. List the file permissions.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/group
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/group

 6. Ensure that the operators group owns files that are created in the /tmp/shared directory.
    6.1 Set the group ID to the operators group for the /tmp/shared directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ chmod g+s /tmp/shared

    6.2 Create a ops_db.txt file in the /tmp/shared directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/ops_db.txt

    6.3 Verify that the operators group is the group owner for the new file.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/ops_db.txt

7. Create an ops_net.txt file in the /tmp/shared directory. Record the ownership and permissions.
Change the umask for the operator1 user. Create an ops_prod.txt file. Record the ownership and permissions of the ops_prod.txt file.
    7.1 Create an ops_net.txt file in the /tmp/shared directory.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/ops_net.txt

    7.2 List the permissions of the ops_net.txt file.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/ops_net.txt

    7.3 Change the umask for the operator1 user to 027. Confirm the change.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ umask 027
    [operator1@servera ~]$ umask
    0027

    7.4 Create an ops_prod.txt file in the /tmp/shared/ directory.
    Verify that newly created files have read-only access for the operators group and no access for other users.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/ops_prod.txt
    [operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/ops_prod.txt

8. Open a new terminal window and log in to servera as operator1.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh operator1@servera

9. List the umask value for operator1.
[operator1@servera ~]$ umask
0022

10. Change the default umask for the operator1 user. The new umask prohibits all access for users that are not in their group. Confirm that the umask is changed.
    10.1 Change the default umask for the operator1 user to 007.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ echo "umask 007" >> ~/.bashrc
    [operator1@servera ~]$ cat ~/.bashrc
    # .bashrc

    # Source global definitions
    if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
    fi
    ...output omitted...
    umask 007

    10.2 Log out and log in again as the operator1 user. Confirm that the change is permanent.
    [operator1@servera ~]$ exit
    logout
    Connection to servera closed.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ssh operator1@servera
    ...output omitted...
    [operator1@servera ~]$ umask
    0007

11. Create an ops_prod2.txt file in the /tmp/shared/ directory.
Verify that newly created files have read and write access for the operators group and no access for other users, due to the new umask of 007.
[operator1@servera ~]$ touch /tmp/shared/ops_prod2.txt
[operator1@servera ~]$ ls -l /tmp/shared/ops_prod2.txt

12. On servera, close all operator1 and student user shells. Return to the workstation system as the student user.
[operator1@servera ~]$ exit
