1. On the workstation machine, determine how to prepare a man page for printing.
Specifically, find which is the default format or rendering language for printing.
    1.1 Use the man man command to determine how to prepare a man page for printing.
    [student@worksation ~]$ man man
    Press q to quit the man page.

2. Create a PostScript-formatted output file of the passwd man page. Call the file passwd.ps and place it in the student user's home directory.
Determine the file format. Inspect the contents of the passwd.ps file by using the less command.
    2.1 Use the man -t command to create a formatted file of the passwd man page.
    [student@workstation ~]$ man -t passwd > passwd.ps
    [student@workstation ~]$ ls -al

    2.2 Use the file command to determine the file format.
    [student@workstation ~]$ file /home/student/passwd.ps

    2.3 Use the less command to view the /home/student/passwd.ps file.
    [student@workstation ~]$ less /home/student/passwd.ps

3. By using the man pages, find which commands you can use for viewing and printing PostScript files.
    3.1 Search in the man pages for information about PostScript files. Use the -k option for this purpose.
    [student@workstation ~]# man -k postscript viewer

4. Learn how to use the evince(1) viewer in preview mode. Also, determine how to open a document to start on a specific page.
Open your PostScript file by using evince three times: first by using the default mode, and then with the preview mode option, and finally to start at page 3.
Close your document file when you finish.
    4.1 Use the man evince command to learn how to use the viewer in preview mode.
    [student@workstation ~]$ man evince
    Press q to quit the man page.

    4.2 Use the evince command to open the /home/student/passwd.ps file.
    [student@workstation ~]$ evince /home/student/passwd.ps

    4.3 Use the evince -w /home/student/passwd.ps command to open the file in preview mode.
    [student@workstation ~]$ evince -w /home/student/passwd.ps

    4.4 Use the evince -i 3 /home/student/passwd.ps command to open the file at page 3.
    [student@workstation ~]$ evince -i 3 /home/student/passwd.ps

5. By using the man pages, research lp(1) to determine how to print any document to start on a specific page.
Without entering any commands (in the absence of printers), learn the syntax, in one command, to print only pages 2 and 3 of your PostScript file.
    5.1 Use the man lp command to determine how to print specific pages of a document.
    [student@workstation ~]$ man lp
    Press q to quit the man page.

6. Use the Firefox browser to open the system's man page directory (/usr/share/doc) and browse to the man-db package subdirectory. View the provided manuals. After you finish reviewing the man-db manuals, locate and browse to the kexec-tools package subdirectory.
View the kexec-kdump-howto.txt file, which describes important system configurations that are stored in the /etc/sysconfig directory.
    6.1 Use firefox /usr/share/doc to view system documentation. Browse the man-db subdirectory. Click the manuals to view them.
    [student@workstation ~]$ firefox /usr/share/doc

    6.2 In the Firefox browser, locate the kexec-tools package subdirectory and view the kexec-kdump-howto.txt file.
    This file describes important system configurations that are stored in the /etc/sysconfig directory.
    Close the document and Firefox when finished.
