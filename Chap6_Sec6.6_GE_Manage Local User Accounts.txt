[student@workstation ~]$ lab start users-user


1. From workstation, open an SSH session to servera as the student user, and switch to the root user.
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh student@servera
...output omitted...
[student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for student: student

2. Create the operator1 user and confirm that it exists in the system.
[root@servera ~]# useradd operator1
[root@servera ~]# tail /etc/passwd

3. Set the password for operator1 to redhat.
[root@servera ~]# passwd operator1
Changing password for user operator1.
New password: redhat
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password: redhat
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

4. Create the additional operator2 and operator3 users. Set their passwords to redhat.
    4.1 Add the operator2 user. Set the password for operator2 to redhat.
    [root@servera ~]# useradd operator2
    [root@servera ~]# passwd operator2
    Changing password for user operator2.
    New password: redhat
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password: redhat
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

    4.2 Add the operator3 user. Set the password for operator3 to redhat.
    [root@servera ~]# useradd operator3
    [root@servera ~]# passwd operator3
    Changing password for user operator3.
    New password: redhat
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password: redhat
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    
5. Update the operator1 and operator2 user accounts to include the Operator One and Operator Two comments, respectively.
Verify that the comments exist for the user accounts.
    5.1 Run the usermod -c command to update the comments of the operator1 user account.
    [root@servera ~]# usermod -c "Operator One" operator1

    5.2 Run the usermod -c command to update the comments of the operator2 user account.
    [root@servera ~]# usermod -c "Operator Two" operator2

    5.3 View the /etc/passwd file to confirm that the comments for each of the operator1 and operator2 users exist.
    [root@servera ~]# tail /etc/passwd

6. Delete the operator3 user along with any personal data of the user. Confirm that the operator3 does not exist.
    6.1 Remove the operator3 user from the system.
    [root@servera ~]# userdel -r operator3

    6.2 Confirm that the operator3 user does not exist
    [root@servera ~]# tail /etc/passwd

    6.3 Confirm that the operator3 user home directory does not exist.
    [root@servera ~]# ls -l /home

    6.4 Exit the root user's shell to return to the student user's shell.
    [root@servera ~]# exit

    6.5 Log off from the servera machine.
    [student@servera ~]$ exit
